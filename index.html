  <h2>About Vossmed</h2>
  <p>Do Students & Young people and adolescents know the right and healthier choices for their health and wellbeing?<br><br>
    
If 'Yesâ€™, what will make it easier for them to choose right? How can Vossmed interventions targeted at SYA, and families make a positive impact on their health and wellbeing? Health is affected by social and economic factors such as education, employment, geographic location, health system and others. The field of social medicine explores the underlying factors which affect the health of populations and provides further insight for health policy decision-makers to act. Vossmed translates the theory into Action!

        <h2>Healthy Choices</h2>
  <p>Evidence shows that there is a clear linkage between the life choices people make and their health status. Through a better understanding, of how health status is modified by the socio-economic environment, SYA & families will be equipped to make well-informed choices, to improve their health and well-being.
